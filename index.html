    <h1>chrisrhoden's osfolio</h1>
    <p class='dialog info'>
      chrisrhoden has a new portfolio site which lists some of his proprietary
      work, which is available at <a href="http://folio.chrisrhoden.com">folio.chrisrhoden.com</a>.
      You should probably check it out.

    <p>
      Hello! <a href='http://chrisrhoden.com/'>chrisrhoden</a> is
      using <a href="http://github.com">github</a> to manage his
      open-source and publicly maintained software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, github does not currently have a good way to mark
      projects with different levels of completeness. Rather than develop
      in a cave, chrisrhoden has opted to use this page to clearly mark
      which projects should be considered well-developed and which are
      rather pie-in-the-sky, silly ideas that he has had and created
      repositories to chip away at.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following projects are <em>in early planning</em>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href='http://github.com/chrisrhoden/metabot'>metabot</a> (ruby)
        <br />
        <span class='description'>

      </li>

      The following projects were <em>specifically created for chrisrhoden's

      bottom of a github project's main page) which explains the purpose of
      a given project, as well as installation and basic use when appropriate.
    </p>
    <p class='dialog info'>
